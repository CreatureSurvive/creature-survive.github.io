 I'm a hobbyist programmer and Unity3d asset developer. I'm currently working on
 on a multiplayer FPS game in unity using Forge Networking. I am in the process
 of applying to school to begin working on a degree in computer engineering.

 By day I'm an ironworker in Tennessee who hates every second of it and cant wait
 to jump into my future career in programming and move back to Colorado Springs.
